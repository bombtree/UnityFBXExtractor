# UnityFBXExtractor
Extract assets from FBX files as directly into your Unity project as native Unity files.

Allows you to extract:
- Objects (as prefabs)
- Animations
- Meshes
- Materials

Copy the FBXExtractor folder to your Unity project's Assets folder.

In the Unity editor Project tab right-click on the .FBX file you wish to extract, and click "Extract FBX."

This will open a new window where you can select the assets that you can extract to your project with drop down tabs for each object type.
